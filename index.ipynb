    "In this lab we are going to practice making a very simple web application. To do this, we will be using a framework called Flask, which allows us to create an application that communicates with our browser. We will define a route, and have it return a string \"Hello world\". Finally, we will start a local server and visit the route in our browser, which will make a request to our program, which should then return our \"Hello world\" string. Don't worry if that sounds a bit confusing. It will become a lot clearer shortly. Let's get started!"
